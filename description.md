## 🔍 Weekly Structure

Each week includes a lecture and a problem set:

- **Lecture**: Core concepts and theory
- **Problem Set**: Hands-on assignments using real-world examples (e.g., finance, forensics, gaming)

```text
✅ Watch Lecture
✅ Submit Problem Set
✅ Repeat until Week 10
```

Final project: A self-directed, full-stack programming project applying all learned skills.
