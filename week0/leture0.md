## 👋 Welcome!

- This course is about **problem solving**, not just programming.
- You’ll learn how to think computationally and apply these skills beyond CS.
- “Drinking from the firehose” – it’s intense, but you’ll grow significantly.
- Don’t worry if you’re new – most students are!

---

## 🤝 Community

- Students from Harvard College, Extension School, and edX.
- Join events like CS50 Puzzle Day, Fair, Hackathon, and Lunches (Harvard only).

## 💡 Problem Solving and Binary

- Programs are black boxes: **input → processing → output**.
- Computers use **binary (base-2)**: only `0` (off) and `1` (on).
- Bits and transistors are the building blocks of computing.

```plaintext
Example (3-bit binary):
4 2 1
0 1 1 → 3
```

- **Byte = 8 bits** → can represent values `0-255`.

---

## 🔤 ASCII and Unicode

- **ASCII** maps numbers to characters (e.g., `A` = 65).
- ASCII table: 0–127 characters.
- **Unicode** supports a much wider range: symbols, languages, emoji.

---

## 🎨 RGB (Color Representation)

- Digital colors are stored using **RGB** (Red, Green, Blue).
- Each color uses one byte (0–255).

```plaintext
RGB(72, 73, 33) → Light yellow
```

- Pixels = RGB values; videos = sequences of images.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms & Big-O

- **Algorithm** = step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
- Example: Finding a name in a phonebook.
- **Big-O Notation** shows algorithm efficiency:
  - Linear: `O(n)`
  - Binary Search: `O(log n)`

---

## 🔧 Pseudocode

- Write logic in human language before coding.
- Encourages clear thinking and debugging.

```plaintext
1 Pick up book
2 Open to middle
3 Look at name
4 If match → done
5 Else go left/right → repeat
```

---

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence

- Instead of hardcoding every rule, AI uses **machine learning**.
- In CS50, only use **CS50.ai** for assistance.

---

## 🧱 Scratch Programming

- Visual programming language by MIT.
- Uses blocks: no syntax errors!
- Great for building logic and understanding programming basics.

### Example: Hello World in Scratch

```plaintext
when green flag clicked
→ say "hello, world"
```

### Example: Interactive Program

```plaintext
ask "What's your name?"
→ say "Hello, [name]"
```

---

## 🧩 Abstraction & Functions in Scratch

- **Abstraction** = simplify complex problems.
- Use custom blocks (functions) and loops to reduce redundancy.

### Example

```plaintext
define meow
→ play sound Meow
→ wait 1 sec

when green flag clicked
→ repeat 3 times:
   → meow
```

---

## 🔀 Conditionals

- React to changes (e.g., mouse click or video motion).
- Use `if`, `else`, and loops.

### Example

```plaintext
if touching mouse-pointer
→ play sound Meow
```

---

## 🎮 Oscartime Game

- Add costume-switching and interaction.
- Move objects randomly, drag with mouse, implement scoring.

---

## 🕹 Ivy’s Hardest Game

- Use `go to`, `forever`, `if`, and keyboard input.
- Movement, wall collisions, and enemy behaviors.
- Example: sprite follows another sprite using `point towards`.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Problem-solving is central to CS.
- Learn how to think algorithmically.
- Understand data representation: text, color, images, etc.
- Begin programming with Scratch before moving to C and Python.
- Learn core concepts: abstraction, loops, conditionals, functions.
- Welcome to CS50!
